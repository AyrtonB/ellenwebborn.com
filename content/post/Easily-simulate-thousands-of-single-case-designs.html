<p>Last week I was teaching at the <a href="https://scdinstitute2018.com/">Summer Research Training Institute on Single-Case Intervention Design and Analysis workshop</a>, sponsored by the National Center for Special Education Research (part of the Institute of Education Sciences).
While I was there, I shared <a href="https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/ARPsimulator/">a web-app for simulating data from a single-case design</a> (to be clear: totally fake data!).
This is a tool that I put together a couple of years ago as part of my <a href="/software/arpobservation/">ARPobservation R package</a>, but haven’t ever really publicized or done anything formal with.
It provides an easy way to simulate “mock” data from a single-case design (treatment reversal designs, multiple baseline designs, or alternating treatment designs) where the dependent variable is measured using systematic direct observation of behavior.
The simulated data can be viewed in the form of a graph or downloaded as a csv file.
And it’s quite fast—simulating 1000’s of mock single-case designs takes only a few seconds.
The tool also provides a visualization of the (hypothetical) distribution of effect size estimates that you could anticipate observing in a single-case design, given a set of assumptions about how the dependent variable is measured and how it changes in response to treatment.</p>

<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>Here’s an example of the sort of data that the tool generates.
Say that you’re interested in evaluating the effect of a Social Stories intervention on the behavior of a child with autism spectrum disorder, and that you plan to use a treatment reversal design.
Your primary dependent variable is inappropriate play behavior, measured using frequency counts over ten minute observation sessions.<br />
The initial baseline and treatment phases will be 7 sessions long.
At baseline, the child engages in inappropriate play at a rate of about 0.8 per minute.
You anticipate that the intervention could reduce inappropriate play by as much as 90% from baseline.
Enter all of these details and assumptions into the simulator, and it will generate a graph like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-A.png" /></p>
<p>Hit the “Simulate!” button again and you might get something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-B.png" /></p>
<p>Or one of these:</p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-C.png" />
<img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-A.png" />
<img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-A.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-D.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-E.png" /></p>
<p>All of the above graphs were generated from the same hypothetical model, so the variation in the clarity and strength of the functional relation is due to random error alone.
The simulator can also produce graphs that show multiple realizations of the data-generating process. Here’s one with five replications:</p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-5.png" /></p>
<p>And here’s the same figure, but with trend lines added:</p>
<p><img src="/img/Crozier-Tincani-simulated-data-trend.png" /></p>
<p>The trend lines represent the overall average level of the dependent variable during each session, across infinitely replications of the study.
The variability around the trend line provides a sense of the extent of random error in the measurements of the dependent variable.</p>
<p>I think it’s an interesting exercise to</p>
