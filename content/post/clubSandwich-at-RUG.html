<p>Last night I attended a joint meetup between the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Austin-R-User-Group/">Austin R User Group</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/">R Ladies Austin</a>, which was great fun. The evening featured several lightning talks on a range of topics, from breaking into data science to network visualization to starting your own blog. I gave a talk about sandwich standard errors and my <a href="/software/clubsandwich">clubSandwich R package</a>. Here are links to some of the talks:</p>
