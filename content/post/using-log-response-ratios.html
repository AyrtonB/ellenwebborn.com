<p>One of the papers that came out of my dissertation work (<a href="/files/Measurement-comparable-ES.pdf">Pustejovsky, 2015</a>) introduced an effect size metric called the <strong>log response ratio</strong> (or LRR) for use in meta-analysis of single-case research—particularly for single-case studies that measure behavioral outcomes through systematic direct observation. The original paper was pretty technical since it focused mostly on a formal measurement model for behavioral observation data. I’ve just completed a tutorial paper that demonstrates how to use the LRR for meta-analyzing single-case studies with behavioral outcomes. In this paper, I’ve tried to present the methods in as accessible a manner as I could muster, to provide a sort of “user’s guide” for researchers wanting to apply the LRR for their own work. You can find the <a href="https://osf.io/4fe6u/">working paper</a> and <a href="https://osf.io/c3fe9/">supplementary materials</a> (including data and replication code) on the Open Science Framework. I would welcome your feedback and questions about this work!</p>
