<p>In today’s Quant Methods colloquium, I gave an introduction to the logic and purposes of Monte Carlo simulation studies, with examples written in R.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/files/Simulations-in-R-2016.html">Here are the slides</a> from my presentation.</li>
<li>You can find the code that generates the slides <a href="https://gist.github.com/jepusto/bf6cdb6e393f54470ba4d016199c6eb8">here</a>.</li>
<li>Here is my <a href="/Designing-simulation-studies-using-R">presentation on the same topic</a> from a couple of years ago.</li>
<li><a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/beta_binomial_baseball/">David Robinson’s blog</a> has a much more in-depth discussion of beta-binomial regression.</li>
<li>The data I used is from <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-database.html">Lahman’s baseball database</a>.</li>
</ul>
