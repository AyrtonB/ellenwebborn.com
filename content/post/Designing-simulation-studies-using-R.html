<p><a href="/files/Designing-simulation-studies-using-R.pdf">Here are the slides</a> from my presentation at this afternoon’s Quant. Methods brown bag. I gave a very quick introduction to using R for conducting simulation studies. I hope it was enough to get people intrigued about the possibilities of using R in their own work.</p>
<p>The second half of the presentation sketched out a quick-and-dirty simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behrens%E2%80%93Fisher_problem">Behrens-Fisher problem</a>, or more specifically the coverage rates of 95% confidence intervals using Welch’s degrees of freedom approximation, given independent samples with unequal variances. Here is <a href="https://gist.github.com/jepusto/7686463">the complete code</a>. As I mentioned in the talk, there’s lots of room for improvement. The main point that I was trying to illustrate is that simulations have five distinct pieces:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a data generating model,</li>
<li>an estimation procedure,</li>
<li>performance criteria,</li>
<li>an experimental design (parameter values and sample dimensions), and</li>
<li>analysis and results.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is useful to write simulation code that reflects the structure, so that it is easy for you (or other people) to read, revise, extend, or re-run it. And then post it on your blog.</p>
