<p>Iâ€™m pleased to announce that the <a href="https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/">Campbell Collaboration</a> has just published a new discussion paper that I wrote with my colleagues Jeff Valentine and Emily Tanner-Smith about <a href="https://campbellcollaboration.org/library/effect-sizes-single-case-designs-campbell-discussion-paper-1.html">between-case standardized mean difference effect sizes for single-case designs</a>.
The paper provides a relatively non-technical introduction to BC-SMD effect sizes and a tutorial on how to use the <a href="https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/scdhlm/">scdhlm web-app</a> for calculating estimates of the BC-SMD for user-provided data.
If you have any questions or feedback about the app, please feel free to contact me!</p>
