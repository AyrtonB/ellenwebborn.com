# __James E. Pustejovsky__

I am a statistician and assistant professor in the College of Education at the University of Texas at Austin, where I teach in the Educational Psychology department. My research focuses on development of statistical methodology for problems in education, psychology, and other areas of social science research, with a particular focus on methods related to meta-analysis and research synthesis.
