I am a Research Associate in Data Science and End Use Energy Demand at the [UCL Energy Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/) working on the [Smart Energy Research Lab (SERL)](https://www.serl.ac.uk) project - developing a database of smart meter (and linked contextual) data for UK-based researchers.
