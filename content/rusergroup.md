I set up the **bseeR user group** in 2019 as a group for members of the Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources [(BSEER)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/bartlett-school-environment-energy-and-resources) who code with R. With the arrival of COVID-19 we moved online and have now opened up the group to the wider R community at UCL and beyond.

We currently meet every 4 weeks on Thursdays at 1-2pm UK time. The idea is to create a friendly space for R users to come together, listen to a talk (typically 20-40 minutes) and ask questions. We aim to have a variety of talks to benefit beginners and more advanced R users.
