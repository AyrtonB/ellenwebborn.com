### ARPobservation

An R package for simulating different methods of recording data based on direct observation of behavior, where behavior is modeled by an alternating renewal process.

- [Available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ARPobservation)
- [Installation instructions]({{site.url}}/getting-started-with-ARPobservation/)
- [Source code on Github](https://github.com/jepusto/ARPobservation)
- [ARPsimulator](https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/ARPsimulator/): An interactive web application for simulating systematic direct observation data based on the alternating renewal process model.

### clubSandwich

An R package for calculating cluster-robust variance estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) with small-sample corrections, including the bias-reduced linearization estimator of Bell and McCaffrey (2002).
