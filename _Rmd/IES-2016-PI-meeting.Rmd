I am just back from the Institute of Education Sciences 2016 Principal Investigators meeting. Rob Horner had organized a session titled "Single-case methods: Current status and needed directions" as a tribute to our colleague Will Shadish, who passed away this past year. Rob invited me to give some brief remarks about Will as a mentor, and then to present some of my work with Will and Larry Hedges on effect sizes for single-case research. Here are [the slides from my part of the presentation]({{ site.url}}/files/Single-case-methods-IES-PI-meeting-2016.pdf).
