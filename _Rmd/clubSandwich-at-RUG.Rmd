Last night I attended a joint meetup between the [Austin R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-R-User-Group/) and [R Ladies Austin](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/), which was great fun. The evening featured several lightning talks on a range of topics, from breaking into data science to network visualization to starting your own blog. I gave a talk about sandwich standard errors and my [clubSandwich R package](http://jepusto.github.io/software/#clubsandwich). Here are links to some of the talks:

- Caitlin Hudon: [Getting Plugged into Data Science](https://www.slideshare.net/CaitlinGarrett1/getting-plugged-into-data-science-87767332)
