One of the methodological decisions that one must make when conducting a meta-analysis is whether to use a fixed effects (FE) model or a random effects (RE) model. Oftentimes, this decision is framed in terms of whether there is heterogeneity in the effect sizes to be synthesized. According to this line of thinking, the FE model is appropriate if one is willing to assume all all of the studies to be synthesized are estimating a common effect size parameter, while the RE model is appropriate if the true effect size parameters are heterogeneous. Here, the FE model is _nested_ within the RE model, meaning that the FE model is simply a special case of the RE model with heterogeneity equal to zero. Furthermore, because RE is strictly more general (making less restrictive assumptions), it should almost always be preferred. However, this is not the only way of thinking about the distinction between these models. 

A more nuanced perspective, articulated in [Hedges and Vevea (1998)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.3.4.486) and recently in [Rice, Higgins, and Lumley (2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssa.12275), is that the choice between FE and RE models should be made on the basis of one's inference model. Here, the FE model is appropriate if the goal of the meta-analysis is only to summarise the set of studies identified for inclusion, without drawing any generalizations to a larger population of studies. This is sometimes called _conditional inference_ because the analysis treats the true effect sizes as fixed quantities (i.e., it conditions on the true effects), even if they were sampled from a larger population. Crucially, conditional inference with the FE model is a valid approach _even if the true effects are heterogeneous_. On the other hand, the RE model is appropriate if the goal of the meta-analysis is to draw inferences about a larger population of studies, from which the included studies are sampled. From this perspective, one could argue that it is actually the RE model that makes stronger assumptions, insofar as it requires assuming that the studies to be synthesized are representative of some larger population of studies, which is often only vaguely specified. 

This post is not going to settle the question of which inferential model is more appropriate. Instead, I raise the distinction because I want to highlight how robust variance estimation (RVE) methods fit into the picture.
In short: __*RVE is for random effects models*__, in the sense that RVE is based on an inference model where the included studies comprise a sample from a larger population. If one adopts the FE inference model and limits generalizations to the set of included studies, RVE _will not work_ in the presence of between-study heterogeneity.  

Now let me back up for a second because you might be asking: "What's RVE?" RVE is a statistical technique for estimating standard errors, calculating confidence intervals, and conducting hypothesis tests about mean effect size parameters (and more generally, meta-regression coefficients) that relies on weaker assumptions than standard methods. [Sidik and Jonkman (2006)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2005.07.019) argued for the use of RVE in univariate meta-analysis models ( where each study contributes a single effect size estimate) because RVE produces more accurate variance estimates and confidence intervals than conventional methods. [Hedges, Tipton, and Johnson (2010)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.5) introduced RVE methods for the more general case of meta-regression models with dependent effect sizes (where studies can contribute multiple, possibly correlated effect size estimates). In practice, it is quite common to have studies that contribute multiple effect size estimates, but without also providing the information necessary to accurately estimate their correlation. Without that information, other methods of handling dependence become tenuous, while  RVE estimates are robust to mistaken assumptions about the correlation. Because of these advantages, RVE is now quite commonly used in meta-analyses within education, psychology, and other social science fields.

The title of [Sidik and Jonkman's (2006)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2005.07.019) paper should make it clear that RVE is for random effects models (it's called "Robust variance estimation for random effects meta-analysis"), but the point is not quite as explicit in [Hedges, Tipton, and Johnson (2010)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.5). Instead, the random effects inference model is implicit in the asymptotic assumptions by which RVE is justified. Less directly, the connection between RVE and the RE inference model can also be seen in the working models introduced for use with RVE, which are based on a random effects model. The point I want to emphasize here is that RVE is _only_ for the random effects inference model. It won't work with the FE model for conditional inference.
